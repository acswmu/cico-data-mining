Parkview Campus' lab uses a card swipe system to check in/out computers.

Each time a person comes in or leaves a time stamp is taken.
Using this data we have been tasked with solving a few questions.

Which computers are used the most are which are the least used?
Which rows of computers are most commonly used?
What day of the week is the lab most busy?
What times are peak times?
What is the average time a student uses a computer?
What is the median time a student uses a computer?
What is the rate of increase for lab load as the semester goes along? (per week?)
Would it be worth increasing open times on Friday to later?

Input is initially in the form
| Time Stamp | In/Out | Computer Name |
